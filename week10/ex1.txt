The monitor.c program detected an event for myfile11.txt, as it is situated in the directory monitored by the program.

Conversely, there was no event reported by the monitor.c program for myfile13.txt. This is due to the fact that alterations made to the original file (/tmp/myfile1.txt) do not impact the symbolic link (myfile13.txt). Unlike hard links, myfile13.txt merely points to the file's path without sharing its inode.

The number of hard links is one, achieved by invoking the unlink_all function, which deletes all hard links associated with the same inode. Nonetheless, myfile13.txt persists as a symbolic link.
