In both execution instances, a distinction arises primarily due to the alteration of the root directory in the first run. The initial run involves a modification of the process's root directory to the mount point of the Loop File System (LOFS). This action establishes an isolated environment characterized by a constrained set of files and directories within the LOFS.

Conversely, the second run takes place without any adjustment to the root directory, allowing the program to execute within the unaltered system environment. In this scenario, additional system directories such as /home, /proc, and /sys are present, augmenting the overall file structure. Despite this divergence in the file system view, the shared libraries utilized by the program persistently originate from the LOFS.

This distinction underscores the impact of changing the root directory using the chroot command, illustrating its capacity to segregate the execution environment and influence the perceptible file system layout.
